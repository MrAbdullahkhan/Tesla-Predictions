# Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project aims to predict the closing prices of Tesla's stock using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages Keras for building the LSTM model.

## Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of the stock market. This project uses a deep learning approach with LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting. The model is trained to predict the closing prices of Tesla stock based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the historical stock price data of Tesla, which includes the Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume. The `Close` price is used as the target variable for predictions. Make sure the dataset is saved as `tesla_stock.csv` in the project directory.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- keras
- tensorflow
